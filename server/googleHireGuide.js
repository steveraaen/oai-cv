'intro':`Have you ever discovered you’re good at something you're not passionate about? Many of us have. This may be a result of the work you like to do, or it may be something you’ve had to get good at because of a previous project or role. The more skills you have the better — but it’s hard to build a fulfilling career on something that doesn’t excite you. Before you start applying, take some time to ask yourself a few of these questions:

What is something you learned that made everything that came after easier?
Have more of your achievements come as a result of solitary effort or teamwork?
What do you enjoy more, solving problems or pushing the discussion forward?
What is the most rewarding job you've ever had? Why?
Describe the best team you ever worked with. What made that experience stand out?
Now, sit with your history for a moment. Consider all the best, most rewarding elements of your experience, and let them come together to create a picture of where you want to go next in your career.

Why the visualization exercise? Your skills, interests, and goals are the result of your life, your experiences, your triumphs, and your failures. If we hire you based on your skills, we’ll get a skilled employee. If we hire you based on your skills, and your enduring passions, and your distinct experiences and perspectives, we’ll get a Googler. That's what we want.`,

'resumeInstrux': `Keep your old resume next to you for inspiration, but start with a blank document and create a resume specifically designed for each job you want.

For each position do the following to build your job-specific resume:

Align your skills and experience with the job description. Tie your work directly to the role qualifications (and don’t forget to include data).
Be specific about projects you’ve worked on or managed. What was the outcome? How did you measure success? When in doubt, lean on the formula, “accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].”
If you've had a leadership role, tell us about it. How big was the team? What was the scope of your work?
If you're a recent university graduate or have limited work experience, include school-related projects or coursework that demonstrate relevant skills and knowledge.
Keep it short. We don’t have a length requirement, but concision and precision are key — so think twice before letting your resume move onto multiple pages, and take careful aim with your information.
A word on cover letters: they aren’t required (and may or may not be considered), so it’s your call on whether to include one. If you do decide to include a cover letter, many of the same suggestions 
we have for building a good resume apply here as well. For instance, tailor it to the job you’re applying for, tell us how you’ve made a difference and use data to back it up. Draw a direct line between your passion and our position, let us see who you are a bit.`

Did you make it through them both unharmed?  The storm must have been awful at the beach in VA; it was bad enough here.  Somehow my exposed little neighborhood made it through this one unscathed but it wasn't as fierce by the time it reached us.  I was going to attach a picture of how close it came to ruining my summer but can't figure out how to attach a picture on linkedinmail.    I quit because I was losing 'the battle' against better office-politicians and it was wearing away my mojo.  I'm both sad and happy to see the end of summer.  It's getting to be about time to get back to the cashflow producing world.    I'm hoping to do some consulting for hedge funds or the like for a couple/few months before having to fully rejoin the full-time work force.  September & October are hands-down the best months out here so I'll try to split time between here and the city till then.    That said, I share your beach induced entrepreneurial spirit.  I wonder if we have any complimentary skills?    When is your NY fundraiser?  I'll definitely be in NY for part of the week of 9-22 and plan on having my parents out here for the weekend of 9/24.  If your event is that weekend you're welcome to my apartment for the weekend.  It's on 75th between CPS and Columbus.    Thanks for the heads up on the resume typo.  You're GOOD!!

Sadly, 41% of high-poverty students are taught by teachers with neither certification nor a major in the core subjects they teach.

We pay each tutor $50/per hr, tracked by the minute, so you always get paid for precisely the right amount of time for each call with a student you do.   How we Cover Our Cost  We cover the cost of doing this on our platform by connecting our experienced engineer tutors and students with a limited number of companies per month. Then we charge companies a monthly fee to cover the cost of paying you as a tutor to get individuals from underserved communities trained and into great software engineering jobs.   In return for joining, we provide you with a ton of value beyond just being open to earning as a tutor.  ‚úì Access to great software engineering tutorials online! ‚úì Video & voice on-demand support help for any dev questions, i.e., StackOverflow but live engineers who help you! ‚úì Machine learning that tells you how to improve as a dev! ‚úì A number of your choice, between 3-30 of top-rated companies sending you offers!  The time you tutor each month is entirely up to you and flexible around your hours and schedule.   Big changes start on a macro level. Let's help individuals get a chance in software engineering that they otherwise wouldn't have together!  (ETA: 5-10 min for next step)  Steven, if you are interested, the next step would be to onboard as a regular student account at school.veroskills.com.

You gave me the first recommendation by anyone from BLP and I am super grateful. If you would like, I'd be happy to recommend you as well. :)   Also, when I first asked you to recommend me, it didn't occur to me what I might want you to mention. So if you don't mind, would please add that we worked together at Bloomberg? Thank you in advance. :)  If you are open to take it a step further, I'd think it would be helpful to mention a specific instance of our working together. As example, as an Equity Application Specialist, you were one of my teacher mentors in Bloomberg's first analytics training program. After months of grueling training, I was one of the first two cherry-picked to go up to sales to join the well-esteemed West Coast team. At our quarterly West Coast seminars, where you lead the advanced portion of the equity seminars, you saw how well I organized the seminar (Seattle! omg please don't mention my first time with the phone line! lol) and how poised and knowledgeable I was in leading new client trainings so they could get the most out of the Bloomberg terminal. Being so adept at presenting and organizing the seminars, it was no surprise that I was asked to initiate the position of organizing Bloomberg's trade shows nationally and internationally (Mexico City). And when I left for Fox you were sad to see me go... (Okay, now I'm just conjecturing!;)  Thanks again for your help -- it's greatly appreciated! Please let me know if you'd like me to recommend you.  Cheers, Sandra  Write Sandra a recommendation: https://www.linkedin.com/recs/give?senderId=sandrakeros",INBOX

If you are a person that asks, why? Then this could be the role for you :)  Here is a little of what you'll be doing:  - Tackle the challenges of featurizing and modeling large and unstructured data using machine learning and statistical techniques - Manage all aspects of the research and execution process including methodology selection, data collection and quality, modeling and analysis, and performance monitoring - Deliver research findings to investment teams, portfolio managers, and other internal clients - Work within a team to help drive technical innovation through a collaborative R&D process  This is a full time role, which the client is willing to sponsor if required. This role will be remote until 2021, but will ultimately sit in Hudson Yards, NYC.  If interested, lets set up a time to speak this week. Looking forward to connecting!

LTSE will force more transparency and ensure executive compensation is not tied to short-term stock performance. To bring the Long-Term Stock Exchange to life, he's assembled a team of about 20 engineers, finance executives and attorneys. He has also raised a seed round from more than 30 investors, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen; technology evangelist Tim O‚ÄôReilly; and Aneesh Chopra, the former chief technology officer of the United States.

I will keep my eyes open for any opportunities that may fit.  It isn't BLP but the stress is so much less.  I just want to finish and retire from here.  I will have a pension and health benefits if I do.   Hope you are well and I will see what I can find.    Leigh,INBOX

I had already applied via the jobs.nyc.gov site and it doesn't look like I can add a reference after the fact.  I first saw the position on Linkedin and it lists Stacy Abramson as the recruiting contact.  I'm tempted to introduce myself to her (or even to Evan) via LI but figure that might come across as overly aggressive.  Although I transitioned from being an Application Specialist to Product Manager in my last few years at BB, our processes were so home-grown that I'm not sure that the specific role is the right fit.   That said, working for the city I love has huge appeal for me so if you do hear of any roles that I might fit into, I'd love to hear about them.  I've attached my resume and the cover letter I included with my application.  Thanks again for your kind help.  Regards,  Steve   ",INBOX

I certainly don't have the programming chops to be a technologist but this blurb on the careers page made me think there could be a role that's not pure tech, sales, business or product.  So the ideal for me would be something that is ""cross functional"".    ""AlphaSense is seeking smart, innovative and ambitious technology and financial services professionals to join its growing global team.    We look for outstanding candidates in cross-functional areas that include: Computational linguistics, search engine technologies, cloud computing, and securities research.    We are always looking for excellent problem solvers with a sharp intellect and demonstrated creativity.""    Does that make sense?    If you're interested, I sent this cover letter along with my resume.      ""I noticed that my former colleague, Ian Chodos recently joined your firm so I checked out your website.  It‚Äôs sophisticated search for research is a fascinating concept that is sorely needed by investors.  Publishers also must love firms like you who build tools that make their content more discoverable.    At Bloomberg and Dow Jones I gained significant experience with text parsing, search and sales in the context of institutional investors and decided to sent you this note with my resume.    At Bloomberg I was responsible for a text mining process called Message Mining.  Buy-side firms were desperate to free the millions of OTC price quotes they received via email each day from their in-boxes.  We ingested the content, used regular expressions and other pattern matching methods to identify these prices.  Positive matches were then validated against known securities and prices.  Validated data was made available to both the sender and receiver.      While Message Mining searched for specific kinds of data, it got me very interested in the concept of improving search results by using creative indexing techniques.    At Dow Jones I was asked to look into improving the Factiva news aggregation platform as well as tools for editors to generate the most relevant tags for their stories.  It was fascinating.  I also championed the idea for a data visualization-based search results browser.     I‚Äôm a business and sales person but have a strong interest in programming as a hobby.  If you are interested, I have a personal site at http://steveraaen.com.""    ",INBOX

It sounds terrific.  And, I know what you mean about letting the trip unfold vs. plotting/planning every step.  I am great for waltzing through famously significant ruins and artifacts-- then going home and reading about them later.  With that said, I wouldn't have done this if I had access to an information source that didn't involve reading massive amounts of text in the middle of trying to sightsee or traveling around for work.  So, an app that has all the tools you mentioned would be truly great.  Like I said, when I was traveling for Heifer International, we were totally dependent on our in-country staff to shepherd us around.  I can't imagine trying to navigate some of those countries on my own-- and yet, you hear about people doing it all the time.  So, I would think your idea has potential for the casual traveler, and the traveler who gets dispatched to some crazy places.      So, I LOVE the picture you sent of the horse!!!  Where was that taken?  France or Spain?  I can imagine him wanting to come in and join you all.  One time at a horse show, I got off Victor and walked over to a concession truck to get some nachos and a Coke.  While I was placing my order, I was unaware that Victor had sidled up right behind me and was looking intently at the concessions person, who then asked me, ""and what will he be having?"".  I laughed because by this time, Victor nearly had his head over the counter.  Very fun day.  We sat under a tree and Victor ate most of my nachos.     It is going to be 65 degrees here today!!!

That's a more eloquent description than I've come up with so thanks Dixie!    The only need I've seen first hand is the camino; walking past something that looked really interesting, taking out my paperback guidebook and hoping the writer mentioned it.    Most of the time it wasn't mentioned at all and if it was, I wished it told me more about it - in the book - while I was there.  More often than not I'd walk past interesting things and sometimes I'd look them up later.  Even if it DID end up being in the guidebook I'd be left thinking that I wish I had known that while I was actually there.  I would have appreciated it more.      A lot of the ""magic"" of a trip like that was NOT knowing things like exactly how far it was from point A to point B, and not knowing what to expect when I got there.  But there were 3 or 4 times every day that I really wished I knew something that I didn't.  There were also times when it was other people - really pure people who wanted to be detached from modern tools, etc.who really wanted to know where the nearest bus station, or the next water fountain was,  We'd stand around for awhile and guess, and that was kind of charming and all but every now and then we would have REALLY liked to know.    Have you ever used the Trip Advisor mobile app?  It has this ""near me now"" feature.  Wherever you are, you tap it and it asks you if you want food, a place to stay or whatever.  When you pick one it gives you a ""point me there"" option and an arrow shows up that gives you the direction and distance to it. It was amazing.      So all I'm thinking of is an app that puts these things together, tailored for a specific adventure,  Having it as an actual app rather than using them all individually like I did would be so much easier.  If these things were all in one app I wouldn't have used much data because the gps part of it was free!    Anyhow, yeah what you described is pretty much what I meant.  I don't think I can send an attachment on linkedin messages but I'll send you my favorite horse picture from the trip to your regular email.    Thanks!    ",INBOX

I say ""survival"" because you are designing it to also support travelers who navigate off the beaten path, yes?  Which would be quite awesome because the travel guides do not do a good job of covering places that are far-flung, like developing countries.  There's just TONS of information that travelers need to know about those places, so they can stay safe and not wander into say, a civil war. This would be quite a tool for people who must travel and work in sensitive areas around the world-- both from a navigational standpoint and a basic informational standpoint.

I don't want to look too vain in changing pictures all the time!    I want to pitch a business idea to someone.  I'd love to hear what you think.  It came to me as a result of the camino.  Here goes:    Paper guidebooks stink.  Well they're actually pretty good but the content is too subjective.  They can only be so big because people have to lug them around.  The most valuable tools I had on my trek were my phone's compass, Google Maps, Google Translate and the mobile Trip Advisor app.  So I'm convinced that the world needs an e-guidebook platform based on interactive maps and loaded with cool sites to see, places to eat & stay, commentary from old guide books, etc.      It would certainly work for long distance hiking trails.  The French part of the trek was very poorly marked so I'd set google maps to walking directions from village to village and my phone would vibrate when it was time to turn.  AND it gave walking directions through the woods, through corn fields & vineyards - totally different from driving directions.    Combining google maps knowledge of exactly where you are AND which direction you're facing, with the location of places - and street view would be pretty cool.  You could be looking at an old ruin, or a bar or a mountain and it would show you the street view with all of those things labeled.      Whadya think??    ",INBOX

I would use that one if I were you.  So, how was it to live at the beach during this horrifying winter??  God, it was terrible here in Chicago.  We are still freezing-- all though we are finally getting a few temps in the 50s and low 60s.  Giant, massive potholes are all over town.  I am so  glad I have a Jeep.  How was winter at the beach?  Did you have to dig out every other day?      So, we finally got my horse, Victor, going again after almost two years off because of two pretty serious injuries (slipping on the ice which hurt one of his hind legs and then tearing a suspensory ligament on a front leg).  I had a trainer offer to rehab him for me,  but after two weeks, she said that he wasn't ready at all.  Since he was confined to his stall for six months, and then only turned out in a very small area for over a year, he'd lost a lot of muscle and coordination.  I wasn't sure what to do since he needed to be worked in a controlled and disciplined way, or else he might hurt himself again.  We couldn't even think about turning him out in a larger pasture since he would most definitely tear off running and not be strong enough to handle the speed.  Anyway, my sister offered to help me rehab him in a truly unorthodox way.  Since he wasn't ready to carry a rider, we decided to run with Victor while he trotted.  Holly would be at his head holding the lead rope, and I would run along at his side to give him a nudge so that he would step into the corners of the arena as we rounded the turns  (which made him use his hind legs correctly).  We'd stop him and start  him, back him up, go from walk to trot and back to walk again, altering the pacing so that he would have to use his hind legs to keep himself together.  After several months of this craziness, he improved dramatically.  I just recently started riding him at the walk for about 15-20 minutes after each workout session. Last weekend, he came up with a swollen fetlock (ankle).  I am so bummed about it.  I don't think it is too serious, but it means more rest for Victor.  Poor guy.  The joys of horse ownership...

Here is Herb Greenberg's note to his colleagues at CNBC, where he will continue as a contributor:  ""Friends, today is my last day as a full-timer at CNBC. Tomorrow my status shifts to CNBC contributor and it also marks the return to my online roots at TheStreet, where I‚Äôll launch a newsletter focused on risk and restart a daily blog. You can read more about that here:http://investor-relations.thestreet.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=785376  The decision to leave CNBC was a tough one -- as emotionally difficult as when I decided to leave the my 10-year gig as a daily business columnist at The San Francisco Chronicle for TheStreet in 1998, where I remained for six years. During that time I was a frequent CNBC guest and contributor before joining full-time a little more than three years ago.  Why leave and why now? No surprise to those who know me -- it‚Äôs about Southern California. Many of you thought Mary and I were crazy (no -- nuts!) to leave San Diego, where we lived for 10 years, for the East Coast. Turns out you were right. This, our third time doing the East Coast stint, was strike three.   Truth be told -- taxes, earthquakes and fires notwithstanding -- we simply missed San Diego. It had become home, and with my contract about to expire, we decided to go back.  Only one hurdle: To stay at CNBC full-time meant staying at HQ in New Jersey. My seat is in the middle of the newsroom and the in-house, in-studio interaction is an intangible that doesn‚Äôt work the same remotely, let alone from 3,000 miles away.  Our compromise: I‚Äôll revert to contributor, they‚Äôll put a camera in my San Diego house and I‚Äôll return to the studio for a week a month.""

Just when NYC's cynicism was about to swallow me whole, idealism and all, I found this fabulous group of folks.  Can you believe we meditate together before staff meetings?   And we throw fabulous parties... but I'm getting ahead of myself.    For sixteen years, Mothers on the Move (MOM) has brought together South Bronx residents who organize for education, housing, youth and environmental justice.  Even if you've never been to the South Bronx, you've heard about it.  This community is famous for its industrial pollution, unemployment, crime and abandonment.  But there's another story too-- one that I have been privileged to find in every community I've ever visited, and I know you know it too-- its the story of the people who don't give up.  MOM has trained hundreds of South Bronx residents-- Moms, kids, and Dads too-- to take leadership in their community and improve their quality of life.  Whether its quality education, air that won't cause asthma, or housing without leaks and rats, this MOM never stops fighting for her kids.    Saturday, September 27th, MOM is hosting a gala to celebrate these heroes for social justice.  I'm hoping you can come, or at least buy a ticket for one of our friends who can't afford it.  In addition to jamming with our live performers during our cocktail hour and the infamous DJ Laylo later in the evening, we will also enjoy exclusive access to the Bronx Museum of the Arts ""Street Art Street Life"" exhibition exploring the art of collaboration from the 50's to present day, and delight in Ms. Jessie's Famous Soul Food.   All for just $100 ($50 if you're broke ;)    If you have a message for social justice you want to share with the attendees, of if you want to rep your organization, you can also purchase space in our slide show-- you can send words and images, or even a few seconds of video.  (minimum donation $100)    You can reserve your tickets by making a donation on line at www.mothersonthemove.org or letting me know its in the mail (928 Intervale Ave, Bronx NY, 10459.)  More information about Mothers on the Move is available at that website, but we got hacked this month and I haven't had time to fully update it yet.  So if you have any questions about MOM, or about anything else, don't hesitate to call me-- 646-271-5878.
